# ML
This repository includes the implementation of a popular Machine Learning algorithm which is "Multiple Linear Regression". Using various factors from the dataset, the carbon dioxide emission of vehicles is being predicted.

Computer Vision is a subset of Deep Learning- an extension of ML. This repository also includes a Pytorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model which is trained on the MNIST dataset and used to predict the handwritten digits. The accuracy of the model is around 97% and the training logs has been specified as well.
